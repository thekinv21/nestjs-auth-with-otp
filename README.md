## OTP Authentication with NestJS

involves implementing a secure mechanism for verifying user identities using One-Time Passwords (OTPs)

1. **OTP Generation**: A random OTP is generated and sent to the user's registered contact (email).
2. **Storage and Expiration**: The OTP is stored temporarily in a database or cache with an expiration time.
3. **Verification**: The user submits the received OTP for verification. The backend validates the OTP against the stored value and checks its expiration.

This method ensures a secure and user-friendly authentication flow, often used in login processes, transaction verifications, and account recovery scenarios.
